      The new way to secure a reservation at sought after venues.
      <ul>
        <li>Find the venue youâ€™d like to dine.</li>
        <li>Place a bid up to the amount you are comfortable spending for the dinner.</li>
        <li>Win the auction.</li>
      </ul>

      Now go enjoy your dining experience - the total amount you won the auction for is applied to your bill as a minimum spend. Simple as that! 

      Bid. Win. Dine.
